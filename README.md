# Julia-Stuff

Playing around with Julia-lang during breaks between assignments.

Seems like an interesting language for machine learning; claims to have speed similiar to C with the simplicity of Python.

01. A basic Fibonacci sequence. 
02. Basic quick sort algorithm.
03. Recursive sudoku solver.
04. Prime checker. Brute force version. 
    Also contains a python prime checker which I used for benchmarking. found here:  https://gist.github.com/Itsdenty/2fc05a4502770ed9c539aeb455c73f08
