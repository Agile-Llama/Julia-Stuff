Notes about Julia-lang.

-Compilation is simple, type 'Julia' followed by the file name ie hello_world.jl

-Indentation not required, however, the 'end' keyword must be used for things like for loops.

Multi line comment syntax is '#=  =#'

-Can use triple quotation marks for strings, this allows the use of quotation marks in the string ie hello_world = """ "hello world" """. Also allows for easy formatting ie \n \t

-Use $ to interpolate a variable within a string. (Think %s in python) use $variable_name

-Tuples are immutable.

-Julia uses 1 index. So we start counting from 1 not 0 like EVERYTHING else..

-syntax for dictionaries. mydictionary = Dict("Jenny" => "12345678", "Chase" => "9887")
 Calling names from the dict mydictionary["Jenny"] 

-Create an array with array_name = []

-push!(array_name, variable) to add to the end of an array. (Cannot add a diff type?)

-pop!(array_name) to pop the last number off the array.
